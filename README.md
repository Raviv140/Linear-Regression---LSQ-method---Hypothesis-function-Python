# Linear-Regression---LSQ-method---Hypothesis-function-Python
This Function actually calculates the Hypothesis function - the optimal linear line which perfectly matches the all dataset by LSQ method 

By using the Least Squered method(LSQ) the function perfectly find the values of the Hypothesis function(the Linear line) which passes closest to each data point, and by that we can predict the value of y by rely on the x value because these 2 variable are independent.
